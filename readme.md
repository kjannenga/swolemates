## Node/Knex MVC Template

     This project uses Postgres, Knex, EJS, Moment, Express, Heroku, and Bootstrap for styling.  
     SwoleMates is a way for gym owners to connect better with the members of their gym, allow
     gym members to find workout partners, and for events and classes to be able to be joined. 
     In the next version I hope to integrate chat as well as another user role for team members 
     of the gym to be able to be moderators of the posts.
                    
    This is my Q2 Project for Galvanize.
